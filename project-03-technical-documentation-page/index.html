      <h1>Childhood</h1>
      <article>
       <p>Born into the prestigious Nakiri family, Erina is gifted with "God's Tongue", the ability to accurately judge a food's quality to the highest degree. Since her gift became well known, most of her baby food was made by professional chefs to satisfy her incredible tasting abilities. As a young girl, Erina had somewhat of a rivalry with her Danish cousin Alice Nakiri, who also was born into the Nakiri family. Erina, at age 3, snatched Alice's toy from her and thought that the cake that Alice baked for her 4th birthday tasted awful, but was grateful for her kind gesture. Around this time, she became friends with another young girl named Hisako Arato, who pledged all of her efforts to serve Erina.</p>
  
  <p>Around the age of 4, Erina's latent talent as a taste tester became apparent and she begun assisting people in the culinary industry, taste testing countless dishes and critiquing them. Though she took her role seriously as a member of the Nakiri family, she had no passion for cooking at the time. However, things changed when she met Jōichirō Saiba, who was visiting Senzaemon. Though Senzaemon told her she had to return to her room, after hearing her stomach growl, Jōichirō prepared a dish for her. With just a single bite of the dish, she felt an overwhelming sense of warmth and fun from his dish, a feeling never experienced from any other dish she had tasted before.[8] Though his visit was short, Erina developed a deep respect and affection for Jōichirō, so much so that she continues to carry a photo of the two from the visit in her journal. Before he left, she asked if Jōichirō would ever eat her dishes. Jōichirō promised that he would only if she herself became a good chef, thus giving her the motivation she has for cooking. </p>
  
  <p>Six months after Jōichirō's departure, her father, Azami Nakiri, subjected Erina to a particularly brutal regimen, forcing Erina to compare foods and determine precise errors in each, then throwing away the inferior dish, even using physical force to prompt her to do so. With time, this training created Erina's haughty personality as well as a deep seated fear regarding her father. Once Senzaemon found out, he exiled Azami from the Nakiri family and Tōtsuki and tried to repair the damage done to her. Unfortunately, not everything done to Erina could be undone.</p>
      
      <h1>Life in the Tōtsuki Culinary Academy</h1>
      <p>Under the wing of her grandfather after Jōichirō's departure, Erina continued to further her cooking and became a prominent figure in the cooking world. Unsatisfied by most dishes served to her in the aftermath of Jōichirō's departure, she became infamously known throughout the world, as any dish deemed unsatisfactory by her meant the end of anyone's hope of becoming a high class chef. Her prodigious skills and renowned fame easily allowed her to be the top of her class and become the youngest Elite Ten Council member in the history of Tōtsuki Culinary Academy before she even entered the high school level, holding the 10th seat.</p>
  
        <p>Shortly before the start of her high school life, Erina was asked, as a member of the Elite Ten Council, to judge numerous dishes for various companies, most of which left her unimpressed. Unhappy from the lack of excitement from her jobs, Hisako informed her that her last major job was to proctor an entrance exam for the high school level of Tōtsuki Culinary Academy.</p>

      <article>
          <p>Born and raised in a patrician background, Erina is a highly privileged and pampered girl who is used to only the best things in life. She is admired and feared throughout Tōtsuki for her talent, looks, and her influential status. Erina is an egotist, holding dogmatic ideals on absolute culinary perfection. She enjoys a great reputation across the culinary world for her "God Tongue", which was said to either make or break a chef's career. The mere mention of her name was enough to terrify the applicants of Tōtsuki, except for one who was unaware of her reputation.</p>
  
        <p>Much of Erina's personality is a result of the abusive training that her father, Azami, subjected her to in her early childhood. This abusive training also caused her to develop a deep rooted fear of her father, becoming petrified in his presence and unable to think or do the right thing. She is also affected by her mother's abandonment and yearns for her approval.</p>
  
        <p>Due to Erina's haughty personality, she cannot make friends easily as she is disdainful of virtually everyone, to th point that she lacks knowledge on some social conventions. While she detests the idea of romance and showing no interest, she began to like reading Shōjo manga to learn more on romance when Alice teases her about her lack of knowledge about romance. Due to her sheltered background, Erina was not used to living on her own, unable to operate a washing machine. However, during her time in the dormitory, she gained many general living skills and even showed pride in knowing what all the laundry symbols on clothing meant.</p>
  
        <p>After defecting to the Polar Star Dormitory, Erina's perspective on cooking changed after she met the residents over there. She also made new friends who empathised with her after finding out what Azami did to her. Erina comes to care a lot for her friends and shared her knowledge with them, which allowed the rebels to pass the rigged promotion exams. Erina later overcame her fear of her father and vehemently opposed him, denouncing his beliefs.</p>
  
        <p>Like her father, Erina adulates Saiba Jōichirō as the ultimate chef, when the latter had once cooked for her in her early childhood. As such, she judges everyone according to his standards. When she discovered Jōichirō's paternal connection with Sōma, she was shocked to the core.</p>

       <article>
          <p>Erina has no particular cooking or cuisine specialty. Instead her cooking is based upon using high quality ingredients and incredible creativity with the feeling of regality. Erina's cooking and skill easily allowed her to acquire the 10th seat of the Elite Ten Council at the end of her third year of middle school, signifying that she is indeed the best chef of her class and one of the best chefs currently in Tōtsuki. Despite being no more than a mere high school girl, Erina's skill level is already on par with most professional chefs. The clearest demonstration of Erina's cooking prowess came during her Stagiaire assignment where a French cuisine head chef, who single-handedly built the reputation of the said restaurant almost to their first Micheline star, submitted and gave Erina full command of the kitchen in just a few short hours. The 1st Seat of her year, Sōma Yukihira admits that her skill surpasses his own. In the BLUE finals, she was still able to defeat him and win the tournament, despite his dish causing her to have the strongest stripping pulse in the Nakiri family history.</p>

  <li>Culinary Logic - Due to her childhood, Erina is very natural when it comes to logic of the cuisines to create a perfect dish. She excels in this ability when she's judging on Sōma's cooking and then she criticizes his dish on what is the logical ingredient to achieve a dish to achieve a correct limit of the dish's flavor. This is highlighted when she began teaching her dorm-mates in Polar Star Dorm, Ikumi, and Aldini Twins in the Hokkaido seminar that she prepared for them to excel in the Hokkaido examinations.</li>
